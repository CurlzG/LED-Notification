# ThunderBirds-LED-Notification
Ardunio and React Native Combination to make LED Notification
I was asked to build a project, that mimicked the thunderbirds notification system from Season 1 Episode 1. Can be seen in the link down below.

##  My Approach
My apporach for the project was to create, two applications that would interact with each other, the back end would use an esp32 chip that would check for updates 
on a firebase database. The front end would be a react native application that would update requests allow the user to set if they wanted to call or not and who was 
wanting a call. <br> <br>

### The Arudnio Code folder
This contains the arundio code for the backend of the application, the rest of the code is for the react native application
